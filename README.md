# Dental Care
Dental Care is a web-based Dental Center Management System built with React.js, designed for both users (patients) and administrators. Patients can easily register, book appointments, and manage their visit history, while admins can oversee appointments, update records, and maintain clinic operations through a dedicated dashboard. The app offers a responsive interface, secure data flow, and efficient workflow management tailored for modern dental clinics.

## 👥 User Guide

### For Patients (Users):
Patients can sign up or log in using any valid email address (e.g., abc@gmail.com, xyz@hotmail.com, etc.).

After logging in, patients can:

* Book multiple appointments at once.
* View appointment history.
* See upcoming visits they’ve scheduled.

### For Admins:
Admins must sign up using an email address that ends with @admin.com (e.g., admin@admin.com, drjohn@admin.com).

Only users with the admin.com domain are granted admin access.

Once logged in, admins can:

* Access the Admin Dashboard.
* View, update, or delete all patient appointments.
* Manage appointment schedules and clinic operations.
* Add new patients and update their details.
* Upload PDFs (e.g., prescriptions, reports) to patient records.
